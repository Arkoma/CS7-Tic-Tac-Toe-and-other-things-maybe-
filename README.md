Practice all the things, and describe them thoroughly!

Hi folks!

I decided to create a crappy tic-tac-toe game in HTML. I then saw it as an opportunity to get more practice with gitHub and the concepts we have learned in Lambda School. As such, I wish to share it with you guys!

The one rule I have is as follows: comment everything excessively.

Please feel free to add whatever you want, like buttons that do or don't do things, or carousels, or linked lists inside trees inside queues.

I'll try to include any and all additions that are commented excessively and push this "project" in a positive direction.
